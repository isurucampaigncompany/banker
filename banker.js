We are out doing hands-on work to keep waterways healthy, plant and care for native bush, and use new and evolving technologies to reduce our carbon footprint. </p> <p> We certainly do a lot more than folk living in the big smoke who sit in traffic to get to their offices, travel regularly on aeroplanes, and wouldn’t know a Freshwater Plan if they fell over it. </p> <p> Farmers comply with regulation after regulation set by the Government and respond to market pressures. We do not need big corporate banks telling us how to do our jobs from Sydney and Rotterdam. </p> <p> The collusion between big banks to threaten to withdraw services or hike rates is targeted at farmers and rural communities. It is discriminatory and reflects a wider societal demonising of the very people who enable them to put food on their tables. </p> <p> It also fails to take into account evolving scientific knowledge as reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that the measurement models used to assess farming emissions are out of date and vastly overstated. </p> <p> Targeting food producers with expensive and punitive policies could lead to issues of food scarcity and exacerbate poverty by driving up the cost of living. Your bank is directly targeting food producers in New Zealand. It is engaging in policy that we know will see farmers exit the sector. This not only could impact food supply in New Zealand but as one of our most important export markets, a decrease in dairy, beef, and lamb production would impact our economy. </p> <p> Food does not just appear in supermarkets. Someone has to farm it or grow it. </p> <p> Ultimately, most businesses (if not all) have some potential to impact the environment; either directly or indirectly. Will your bank be demanding reports of air travel conducted by all of your business clients? Proof that they use recycling bins in the office? How many hours their workers sit in traffic each week? Will you be demanding any hospitality businesses source their coffee beans from approved, sustainable sources? </p> <p> Is climate change the only area of activism for your bank or are there other ethical issues that you will be assessing all clients on? Will you be demanding reports from retailer clients that provide proof that none of their products were produced in a sweatshop or by child labour? Will you be demanding that businesses hand over their HR policies so you can assess that they are up to your standards? Will you demand a list of countries that they do business with so you can check they align with the bank’s geopolitical policies? </p> <p> OR will you function as a bank and provide lending services to legitimate businesses and leave the activism up to others? </p> <p> I strongly encourage the executives of the bank to consider why they are targeting farmers and rural communities and the consequences of doing so. While you’re at it, you might consider what the role of a bank is and if it is your job to act as a moral and ideological judge. </p> <p> Farmers will move to banks that don’t punish us for doing our much-needed jobs, and if banks continue to operate like cartels and impose discriminatory policies en masse, we will be forced to take action collectively. </p> <p> Farmers are sick and tired of being the punching bag for ill-informed climate activists. We just want to be able to do our jobs to the best of our ability, adhering to the letter of the law, and making appropriate adjustments to reduce emissions. </p> <p> We don’t want bankers in Auckland, Sydney, or Rotterdam treating us like evil polluters out plunder the environment – as they sip the coffees made with milk from our farms and dine on steaks from our stock. </p> <p><strong>Be bankers, not w@nkers.</strong></p> <p><strong>Regards,</strong></p>"
